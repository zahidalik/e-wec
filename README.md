# E WEC App

Currently we are facing a new challenge that the humanity has never faced before. Whole globe is adhering to social distancing policies. Many schools are not functioning physically.

This app is a small step towards creating a virtual environment for tutors and students.

I have created it to help my educational institution.

As per our needs, I have created this app very easy to use. It is just meant to prove a supplementary for our day to day classroom activities and work.

# My first ever App

This is my first ever app in Ruby on Rails.

Hope to continue serve better in future.

# WebRTC App

I am going to make another app for having live sessions between our teachers and the students. That will support the current app.
